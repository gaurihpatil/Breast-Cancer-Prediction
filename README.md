# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project encapsulates a systematic exploration and utilization of machine learning for medical diagnosis. It involves meticulous data handling and preprocessing techniques applied to a
medical dataset, culminating in the construction of a robust Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Xg Boost Classifier. Through this process, 
the project aims to establish a reliable framework for predicting and diagnosing medical conditions. The emphasis lies in demonstrating a structured methodology—from data preparation to 
model evaluation—that underpins accurate medical diagnostics using computational techniques.
